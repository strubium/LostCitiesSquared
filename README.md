Hello and welcome to Strubium steals code from people to make an old mod slightly better 

(Forked from: [Lost Cities Render Fix](https://github.com/Burchard36/LostCities-RenderFix))

(Original Mod: [The Lost Cities](https://github.com/McJtyMods/LostCities))

## Compatibility 
* The Lost Soul's: Use Dev-1 and below.
* Biomes O' Plenty: Supported! Use custom generator to see biomes
* LCPatches: Untested, but should work. 

## Changes (See [changelog.md](changelog.md))
* TileEntitys now get special treatment and aren't placed as normal blocks. (Not my work, this is the power of Burchard36) 
* New "nospawner" profile. Generates buildings with loot, but without mod spawners.
* New "geopol" profile. Generate cities with the power of [GeoPol!](https://github.com/markgyoni/geopol)
* Tweeks to the "onlycity" profile. Railways + Highways.
* Un-privated all the hidden "base" profies.
* Removed the water that generates inside buildings
* Added more language translations  

## Future Plans
* A palette that uses MWC Props
* A config system for city loot as 1.12.2 doesnt support datapacks   
* Remastered Chisel profile (It will look nicer)

### Really Far in the Future Plans
* Investigate the memory leak (https://github.com/McJtyMods/LostCities/issues/251)
* City Zoneing (Downtown, suburbs , etc) (https://github.com/McJtyMods/LostCities/issues/556)
